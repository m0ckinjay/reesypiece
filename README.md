# Hi! I'm Reese. ✌️
I'm a 20 year-old (she/her) first-year computer science student at Ontario Tech University who uses code to get my ideas out. My goal in life is to be able to learn as much of what interests me as possible.

In my spare time, I mess around with the Discord API through <a href="https://github.com/reesypiece">Miyeonie</a>, and voice recognition ~~with DefusalBot~~ in a repository not initialized yet.

## Extra Stuff About Me
- I like K-pop, especially girl groups. Talk to me about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamcatcher_(group)">Dreamcatcher</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/(G)I-dle">(G)I-DLE</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loona">LOONA</a>.
  - ~~Speaking of (G)I-DLE, I ended up buying one album and winning a fansign with Soyeon. I still don't know how that happened.~~ 
- I also like playing video games - you can notice that most of what I code on the side is some sort of companion for at least one game. :P 
- I use the UK-ISO layout despite living in Canada.
- My favourite terminal palette is Dracula, with Gruvbox Dark being a close second.
